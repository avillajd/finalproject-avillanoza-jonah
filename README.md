### Questions I Have for you Efren:

On my website i would like to learn how to make the `<div class="workdescription">` to scroll and keep up with the images if the body copy is not as long as the images i have included. I would like it to have the look in which the user can scroll the images and see the numerous images included in the **Work** section and still be able to read the project description hopefully that makes sense....

This would work for both the Blog page as well.

The **2nd** I am having with the website pertains to the functionality of the music page. I am not able to click **every** song due to the links off to the right being too long horizontally. I've tried to z-index the media player but the links then become unclickable.

Below is the code for the first question:

Currently the section is coded in CSS as such:

```css
.workdescription {
  float: right;
  padding-top: 194px;
  padding-right: 45px;
  font-family: helvetica;
  color: #707070;
  max-width: 500px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.subh3 {
  padding-top: 25px;
}

.locationforproject {
  font-weight: 400;
}

.storyforwork {
  padding-top: 50px;
}
```

Even if it's after the semester is over i'd just like to know how to get it done so i can know as much as i can as a designer in the future.

Thank you for a great semester !
