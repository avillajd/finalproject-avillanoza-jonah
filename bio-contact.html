                <p>I started studying art as a young child and was very interested in visual graphics from a young age. Your brain is a very powerful thing and allows you to see the world based on how you are feeling and being present in critical moments in time. As a child I was very fascinated by animals and their relationship to the world around them. In high school I was sent to an technology Academy to study digital arts and by college I was majoring in studio art my freshman year. I'm a graduate of James Madison University where I took the five year plan for an extra victory lap. I wasn't always at James Madison University however, I started my art career at East Carolina University where I learned the foundations, fundamentals and principles of art. There I was taught to draw exactly what you see. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I'm very inspired by the world around me particularly nature and the water. I've grown up by the ocean my entire life and I don't know what I would do without it. When working with clients I like to gauge what exactly they're looking for and upon meeting them feel out their energy and their intentions before I take clients on. I like to work with people that have an open mind with a good taste in design and outlooks on life. I brand myself as a designer who designs for good people.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For instance many people say things like “I Cant Draw..” this is merely a perspective and can be overcome if people take the time to be present and view the world around them as it exists and not what they believe their eyes to perceive. For example, a soda can is a cylinder that sits in three dimensional space however when you draw that can you focus on every bend turn and organic shape to finally render a lifelike drawing. To think of a can as a cylinder and then try to draw it with that mindset you are not drawing "what you see."" I learned this skill very early and I was able to accelerate in illustration and curtail it to the way that I like to design and paint.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I am a military veteran, a graphic designer, a fine artist, and a music producer. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I look for things that challenge me in my creative process. I like to focus on content that I enjoy for my self. There is heavy use of gesture in my work. There is plenty time for searching and calling for patience. Professional work has a pace and Fine Art has a pace. Both are always on time.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you are not having FUN creating work you should stop. I believe art should still be art. People lose sight of that sometimes and try to make it something it’s not. It means something different to everybody. I am currently having a goodtime, so I’ll continue to create. Mucha, Moser and Roller forever.</p>
